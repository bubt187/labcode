Cox's Bazar–Teknaf Marine Drive is an 80-kilometre-long road from Cox's Bazar to Teknaf along the Bay of Bengal and it is the world's longest marine drive.
Mr x is planning for a solo trip to Cox bazar. He will stay N days and want to ride bike as much as he can on each day. He has W TK for this purpose. Bike rental cost per hour 100 TK and additional 50 Tk service charge without fuel. He have to refill fuel.1 litre fuel cost 100 Tk and the bike can cover 50 km in one litre of fuel.

If the max speed of bike is 50 km/h,  what is maximum of minimum amount kilometers he can ride each day.

Let’s say he want to ride 75 km in the 1st day.
He have to rent bike for 2 hours and need 2 litres of fuel. Each day he have to rent bike independently.
